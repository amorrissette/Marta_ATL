## Marta Atlanta Project 
Using Data and Advanced Analysis to Improve Our Transportation


## Project Data

Data associated with this project is currently available through [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1a3J-7wPbHIy34TtpdGQqe3Ew0QnV-u_l)

Data is acquired using [MARTA Bus Realtime RESTful API](http://www.itsmarta.com/app-developer-resources.aspx)

## Project Outline

this project is organized in to initial preprocessing folders for certain types of data formats

_raw imaging files_ - cortical imaging frames are acquired using the SciMedia MiCAM Ultima system. Dual-camera acquired files are separated to individual cameras using the dual_cnv software from BV_tools

_voltage imaging files_ - after preprocessing, imaging files are converted to voltage images using a ratiometric equalization described in Carrandini et al. 2015

_raw behavioral traces and trial results_ - output from custom labview program is saved in .txt files for each session

_behavioral video files_ - data from 2 high-speed cameras acquire pupil and whisker/licking data for each session
